## Build files for personal site

The site at (travisgerke.com)[https://travisgerke.com] is built using Sean Kross' excellent (`postcards`)[https://github.com/seankross/postcards] package. I embedded some custom features in (my own fork)[https://github.com/tgerke/postcards] of the package. The most important of these is the ability to place a second row of social icons (which are arranged inline instead of stacked in the mobile version of the site). I also placed some descriptive titles beneath my name, which can be specified in the leading `yaml`.
