## Build files for personal site

The site at [travisgerke.com](https://travisgerke.com) is built using a [quarto about template](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html).
Charlotte Wickham and Emil Hvitfeldt's [excellent tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7r24gTEkEY) were immensely helpful in bootstrapping the setup.
In particular, the bones were constructed with the command `quarto use template EmilHvitfeldt/website-template`.


Another key find to help with icon was the amazing [iconify extension](https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-iconify).
I was on the hunt for a Bluesky icon, and this extension opened all kinds of doors, including simple ways to access academicons (e.g. Google Scholar).
